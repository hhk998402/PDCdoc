**Advantages of Big Data:**

• This is one of the biggest problems in today’s cyber world <br>
• If we are able to find a feasible solution to this problem, we may be stepping in the age where we don’t need to worry about the size of the file we download or upload from or on the servers <br>
• This will reduce compressions and increasing details readability understanding capabilities. <br>

**Disadvantages of Big Data:**

• We’ll need a lot of man power to handle such clusters.<br>
• The data will be exposed to more chances of corruption.<br>
• Data sets require a multitude cluster <br>
• Needs a lot of reducer.<br>

**Disadvantages of MapReduce:**

Some of the cases when MapReduce doesn’t work very well:<br>
• When you need a response fast<br>
• Processing graphs<br>
• Complex algorithms<br>
• When map phase generates too many keys<br>
• Joining two large data sets with complex conditions <br>
• Evaluating state machines<br>
• Cascading tasks one after the other.<br>

**Limitations noticed after the implementation of Mapper and Reducer:**

• We were only able to use one reducer. <br>
• There was only a single node In our data set as we were not able to get a multitude cluster. <br>

## Conclusion:

We were able to successfully to implement big data analysis inside the Hadoop ecosystem. Based on our project, we saw how Hadoop system can efficiently process the data and give accurate results. Inferences can be made from the analysis  done on the big data and organisations as well as individuals can make smart decisions based on the same. Using the distributed systems, we can successfully speed up the processing and handle large amount of data concurrently with proper synchronization
 and coherency.
